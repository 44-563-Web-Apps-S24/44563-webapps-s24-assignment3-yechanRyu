        <p>first thing that is interesting about me is I am 27 years old.
            My first year in this university is 2016. I had been in Korea for 4 years before coming back to this university. <br>
            This is my 2nd semester after come back to this university.
            <br>
            High Hopes by Panic! At The Disco is my favorite song, and my favorite computer game is league of legends.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite movie is Howl's <b>Moving Castle</b>. The reason I love this movie is because I enjoy the music it has, such as "Life is a Carousel". <br>Additionally, as an animated film, I appreciate its color palette, atmosphere, and backgrounds </p>

            <p>The table shows 4 songs that I recommend there are jazz or other kinds of music. <br>
                I recommend the songs depending on what I am doing such as working out, traveling, or drinking coffee. <br>
                So, I recommend the readeers to listen to the musics when they are in the situations that I mentioned above.

        <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
        <pre>
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            LEFT JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
        </pre>
        <p>This code represents a left join between two tables, "table1" and "table2". <br>
            A join is an operation that combines data from two tables based on a common column value. <br>
            The "SELECT" part specifies the column names to be selected, and the "FROM" part determines which table the data will be retrieved from.<br>
            It includes all rows from the left table, "table1", and only those rows from the right table, "table2", that have a matching condition specified in the "ON" part.</p>
